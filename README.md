Rebornbuddy plugin for creating orderbot profiles. 

Install:

Clone directly in plugins directory or put files in plugins/GatherUp/ 


Notes:

All generated profiles contain a comment marking it as a gatherup 
profile and which version was used to generate it. This comment is 
required for the profile to be correctly Ã­mported by the plugin. It is 
not meant as watermark and can be freely removed if you so choose.

If a profile has been manually extended; removing the whole comment or 
editing out the verison tag is advised since gatherup will otherwise 
try to parse it and likely fail.
