Rebornbuddy plugin for creating orderbot profiles. 

Install:

Clone directly in plugins directory or put files in plugins/GatherUp/ 


Notes:

All generated profiles contain a comment marking it as a gatherup 
profile and which version was used to generate it. GatherUp looks
for this comment when importing a profile to determaine how to parse it.

Without it importing will not work however you are not required to keep it.
